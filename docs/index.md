# Documentation

## Overview

*Begin with a brief overview of the API, explaining its purpose, benefits, and target audience. This section should give readers a clear understanding of what the API does and why it exists.*


## Authentication and Authorization

*If the API requires authentication or authorization, provide clear instructions on how to obtain the necessary credentials, such as API keys, tokens, or OAuth. Include examples of how to use these credentials in API requests.*

## Endpoint Structure

*Clearly describe the base URL and structure of the endpoints, including the HTTP methods supported (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Organize endpoints logically, grouping related endpoints together.*

## Request Parameters

*For each endpoint, list all required and optional parameters, their data types, and a brief description of their purpose. Include any constraints or validation rules for the parameters.*

## Request Headers

*If applicable, provide a list of required and optional headers for each endpoint, along with their purpose and valid values.*

## Request Examples

*Include example requests for each endpoint, demonstrating how to use the various parameters and headers. Use consistent formatting and code snippets to make it easy for readers to understand and implement.*

## Response Structure

*Describe the structure of the API response, including the format (JSON, XML, etc.) and the various elements within the response. Explain the meaning of each element and any possible values.*

## Response Examples

*Provide example responses for each endpoint, showcasing both successful and error scenarios. These examples should help developers understand what to expect when interacting with the API.*

## Error Handling

*List all possible error codes and their meanings, along with guidance on how to handle these errors in the client application. This will help developers troubleshoot issues and create more robust applications.*

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

*If the API enforces rate limiting or throttling, explain the limitations and how developers can monitor their usage to avoid being blocked or receiving error responses.*
